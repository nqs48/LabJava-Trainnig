# Java Lab--SofkaTrainning
In this challenge we are going to model a question and answer contest, the intention is to design
a solution that allows having a bank of questions with different options for a
single answer, in addition each question must be in a category or a group of
similar questions of the same level, for each round a prize must be assigned to get,
The rounds of the game are levels that increase as the player wins prizes.



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The total of prizes is within the contest but if, given the case, the player pretends
leaving the game can withdraw before answering the question, if on the contrary the player
loses then he would leave the game without the accumulation he would carry at that moment.
